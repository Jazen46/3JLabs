Jason, Jeffrey, Jared

April 8th: Jason pushed his work from the past week or so. None of it works.
      Jason's immediate goal: Get the devkit and AVD working. Then get a live camera working.


For the Spring Break:

Jeffrey: Get the computer end working (push to and pull from database)
	 Learn Android, and catch up with Jason

Jason: Get the camera working, and be able to superimpose images onto the screen

Jared: Work on frontend for the website half of it.

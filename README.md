Intended Functionality:
	 Users can upload images, music, and text.
	 We then link to a QR code, which the Android app processes.
	 Users are then prompted to view or download. Upon which:
	       Main Image (if any) is superimposed onto the camera. 
	       BGM begins to play.
	 Other files will be available to view.
	 Currently only meant to add flavor to an object or location.

Server End: 
Creating an account: 
	 I have not gotten around to making a feedback system. Usernames must be at least 4 letters long, and passwords must be at least 6 letters long and match.

Left to do: 
     Add feedback for unsuccessful registrations/logins.
     Legitimate validation systems. Currently just yes man-ing all requests.
     Popularity systems: likes, dislikes, comments
     Editing your uploads
     General QoL and design improvements.

Android App End:
